The following problem has been described in "About Problem" section same folder in this repository.

The approach for the following was done as :-

2 methods namely

1.Bag of Words

2.TF-IDF Transformation 

were applied to predict the desired outcome and the models which were used for predictions were

1.Logistic Regression

2.Support vector machine

3.Random Forest

4.Multinomial Naive Bayes

5.ADA Boost Classifier

and the best results were obtained by ADA Boost Classifier when applied tf-idf transformation with predicted on f1-score averaged micro.
